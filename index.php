			<section id="about" aria-labelledby="aboutHeading">
				<h2 id="aboutHeading">About me</h2>
				<p>I'm a hard working front-end dev; much prefer being in a busy environment and I love nothing more than getting lost in coding marathons with my headphones on. I am just as happy working on my own or in a team.</p>
				<p>I live in Banbury, Oxfordshire which is an easy 50 minute train ride to London Marylebone. The journey allows me to catch up with blogs, twitter and do things like code my personal site and CV, which is what I'm doing right now on my morning commute.</p>
				<p>As a qualified chef I still love cooking for friends and family when I can. I love most sports, live music and I'm teaching myself the basics of photography with my DSLR.</p>

			<section id="employmentHistory" aria-labelledby="employmentHistoryHeading">
				<h2 id="employmentHistoryHeading">Employment History</h2>
				<p>I have been in the Industry as a front-end web developer full-time since 2006, starting at a company that made web sites for the property industry. Before this I made small web sites for family, friends and word of mouth clients from about 2002 onwards. Below is more detail of the more recent work I have undertaken.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Shelter</dt>
					<dd><em>2013 - July to December</em>
						My role was to support the online team in delivering daily HTML emails using Adestra. As well as this I helped with front-end tasks such as creating the Gingerbread House campaign pages and many more ad-hoc pages as well as regular maintenance using Squiz Matrix.
					</dd>

					<dt>Camelot - The National Lottery</dt>
					<dd><em>2013 - May to July</em>
						Working as a front-end developer on their "Next Generation Internet Platform". I used tools such as IntelliJ, Git and Jira in an Agile environment.
					</dd>

					<dt>Concise Media Group</dt>
					<dd><em>2013 - January to April</em>
						Front-end web developer in the events industry, creating web pages which "sit" within an iPad application for big clients such as Shell, Morgan Stanley and Bank Of America; to name but a few.
					</dd>

					<dt>Various agencies in Oxford</dt>
					<dd><em>2012 - contract front-end web developer</em>
						 I worked for two major Oxford-based design agencies, namely <a href="http://incuna.com" target="_blank">Incuna</a> and RFA Advertising. Both of which created iPad apps for the pharmaceutical industry. My role was to take PhotoShop PSD's and code them into web pages using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Zepto and jQuery, which then "sit" within their iPad apps.
					</dd>

					<dt>tawd.co.uk</dt>
					<dd><em>2012 - self-employed as tawd.co.uk</em>
						 I really enjoyed being able to manage clients and have the final say when it came to design and development and I created some web sites which I'm still proud of today. See my <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> for some which stand out to me.
					</dd>

					<dt>TimberWindows.com</dt>
					<dd><em>2011 - in-house front-end web developer and designer</em>
						In my role at TimberWindows I was responsible for the redesign and build of the rather dated timberwindows.com. Initially, I was hired to redesign and develop the site in its entirety, but in December 2011 the company merged and the focus shifted, I was made redundant with the web site 95% completed in January 2012, as the company sought to unify its CMS to an ASP &amp; .NET platform.
					</dd>

					<dt>MiltonBayer.com - front-end web developer</dt>
					<dd><em>2009 - 2010</em>
						In my time at this company I changed the way the company made web sites by applying my CSS, HTML and SEO skills and implementing quality control, internal standards and best practices for the design and coding of web sites and HTML email newsletters, which significantly changed the quality of the web sites this company made.

				<h2 id="portfolioHeading">Portfolio</h2>
				<p>Here is a list of some of the better projects I worked on in my spare time or whilst self-employed. Some of which are over a year old now - I say this because most of my recent work is private, under development or subject to Non-Disclosure Agreements. So please take this as an example of my abilities twelve months ago and plus. All the design and coding is by myself.</p>
